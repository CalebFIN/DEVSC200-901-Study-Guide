# Compare Software Development Methods: Agile, Lean, and Waterfall


  | Phase | Agile | Lean | Waterfall |
  |-------|-------|------|-----------|
  | **1** | Concept | Identify Value | Requirements |
  | **2** | Inception | Map Value Stream | Design |
  | **3** | Iteration/Development | Create Flow | Implementation |
  | **4** | Release | Establish Pull | Verification |
  | **5** | Maintenance | Seek Perfection | Maintenance |
  | **6** | Review & Retrospective | - | - |

- **Agile** focuses on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration. Its phases are cyclical, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.
- **Lean** emphasizes creating more value for customers with fewer resources by identifying and eliminating waste. Its phases are geared towards optimizing the flow of value through the development process.
- **Waterfall** is a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This method is more rigid and traditionally used for projects with well-defined requirements.


## Agile

### Key Principles
- **Iterative and Incremental**: Agile breaks down the project into small, manageable units allowing for iterative development and frequent reassessment of a project's direction.
- **Collaborative Approach**: Emphasizes teamwork, customer collaboration, and flexibility to change.
- **Customer-Centric**: Focuses on customer needs and satisfaction through continuous delivery of valuable software.

### Advantages
- **Flexibility**: Agile allows for changes in project requirements, even late in development, making it adaptable to changes.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: By involving the customer and focusing on value delivery, Agile ensures the product meets customer needs.
- **Risk Management**: Frequent iterations expose issues early, reducing risks.

### Disadvantages
- **Less Predictability**: Due to its flexible nature, project timelines and budgets can be less predictable.
- **Requires More Involvement**: The collaborative approach demands more time and involvement from stakeholders.

## Lean

### Key Principles
- **Maximize Value, Minimize Waste**: Focuses on delivering value to the customer while minimizing activities that do not add value.
- **Empower the Team**: Encourages giving autonomy to the team, allowing those doing the work to plan and execute tasks.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Seeks to continuously identify and eliminate waste in processes.

### Advantages
- **Efficiency**: By focusing on eliminating waste, Lean increases efficiency in the development process.
- **Quality Improvement**: Continuous improvement leads to higher quality products as processes are constantly refined.
- **Faster Delivery**: Streamlining processes results in faster delivery times to the customer.

### Disadvantages
- **Overemphasis on Cutting Costs**: The focus on reducing waste can sometimes lead to cutting essential processes or resources.
- **Requires Discipline**: Lean's principles require a disciplined approach to be effective, which can be challenging to maintain.

## Waterfall

### Key Principles
- **Sequential Phases**: The project is divided into sequential phases, with each phase starting only after the previous one has completed.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Requires comprehensive documentation before moving on to the next phase.
- **Well-defined Scope**: The project scope, timelines, and costs are determined at the beginning of the project.

### Advantages
- **Predictability**: The Waterfall model offers a clear, predictable timeline and budget for projects.
- **Structured Approach**: Its linear approach is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for projects with well-understood requirements.

### Disadvantages
- **Inflexibility**: Once a phase is completed, it is difficult to go back and make changes without starting over.
- **Risk of Misalignment**: If customer needs change or are not well-understood from the start, the final product may not meet customer requirements.
- **Delayed Testing**: Testing is conducted after the build phase, which can lead to the discovery of issues late in the project.
